The model training pipeline.
CURRENT ROLE / Idea: Trains a base YOLOv8 model on the synthetic/web-scraped dataset to learn general defect features (Spaghetti, Warping).
FUTURE ROLE: Will be used for 'Transfer Learning'—taking the base model and fine-tuning it on the specific images captured from your large-scale printer for maximum accuracy.
